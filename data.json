The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be \"almost correct\", afterwards a program with an error is just \"wrong\"."

It says “do something.” And you go find “something.” And you read it and it says, “do something else” and you go find something and it says, “do something else” and it goes back to the top maybe. And nothing gets done. It’s just relegating the problem to a deeper and deeper level."
